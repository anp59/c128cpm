	PARITY	POKE	PRT	REPEAT	VOL

	40COL		=ON, OFF

This Command is used to turn the 40 column display ON or OFF.  The 40 column
display slows the system  down about 10%.  By  turning it off the the system
will run a little faster.

	BAUD		=50,75,110,134,150,300,600,1200

The modem port BAUD rate  may be  changed with this command.  Setting the BAUD
rate also changes FEEL and to a lesser  extent  REPEAT.   As the  baud rate is
increased the amount of time that the processor has to do things is decreased.
The system handles the serial port using interrupts.  The number of interrupts
per second is 3 times the  baud rate.  See FEEL for more info.

	BACK		=<color#>

Set current screen Background color to color supplied.

	BORD		=<color#>

Set current screen Border color (40 column screen only) to color supplied.

	CHAR		=<color#>

Set current screen Character color to color supplied.

	CURSOR		= {solid, slow or fast} followed by start (space) end

Sets the 80 column display cursor to solid or flash (slow or fast).  The user
may also include one  or two optional  parameters that  set the start and end
scan line for  the cursor.  This can be used to create an underline cursor or
a strike thru cursor.
 CURSOR=FAST 4 will start the cursor at scan line 4 and end on scan line 7. 
 CURSOR=FAST 0 4 will give a half cursor at top of line.
 CURSOR=FAST 7 will give an underline cursor.

	DATE		=[<month>/<day>/<year>] [<hour>[:<min>]]

This command is used to show the current date and time (if no parameters are
supplied) or set a new time and/or date.
DATE   will show the current date and time.
DATE 10: will set 10:00:00 with the current date
DATE 10:45 1/21/85 will set the time and date as shown.

	DRV<letter>   A,B,C,D	=8-0, 8-1, 9-0, 9-1, 10-0, 10-1, 11-0, 11-1

This command  is used to  allow a DUAL disk drive to be used.  The system
defaults drive 8-0 to A, 9-0 to B, 10-0 to C and 11-0 to D. If you have a
DUAL drive it is numbered 8-0 and 8-1.  With  this command you can change
any drive to use 8-1.
DRVC=8-1		will set drive 8-1 to be used as C
DRVB=10-0,DRVC=10-1	will set dual drive #10 as drive B and C

	DUMP xxxx  (address to dump in HEX)

This command will dump 16 bytes of memory starting from the HEX address 
supplied. This is NOT the TPA memory (bank 1) but instead is RAM BANK 0
which is the operation system area.

	FEEL		=0,1...

    Feel is a parameter that adjust the way the keyboard feels.  The keyboard
is scanned with interrupts (the same interrupts that handle the serial port).
Thus  as the  BAUD rate  is  increased  the number  of  key  scans per second
increases.  To  get around this  problem not every interrupt is  used to scan
the keyboard.  FEEL  sets the number of interrupts that  are not used between
each one that is used.  As the number of key scans is increased the processor
slows down. The FEEL parameter is changed when ever the BAUD rate is changed.
The  default  values are  set to  try  to keep about 300 keyboard  scans  per
second.  (At 300 BAUD, FEEL is defaulted to 2).  NOTE: The FEEL value for 600
and 1200 BAUD are adjusted as follows:
	@600 ADJ=((FEEL+1)*2)-1   and   @1200 ADJ=((FEEL+1)*4)-1

	HELP		(=topic)

This HELP file  (CONF.HLP)  works with  CONF.COM  dated  21 Jan 85. There are
two ways to  use HELP.  One way is to type  CONF HELP  which  will  place you
at a  prompt which  will allow you to select  the  topic about which you want
information.  The other way is to use help on a command line as follows:
	CONF HELP=topic
where topic is the specific topic about which you want information.

CONF is designed so that multiple commands  and associated  parameters can be
specified on a single line as shown in the following example:
	CONF char=2,help=feel,repeat=0
sets character color to red, gives help on feel and turns keyboard repeat off.

	MAP		(map character sets)

This command will display both the primary and the alternate character sets.

	PARITY		=<number><parity><stops>

The serial data  can be  sent or received with a number of options.  The normal
and default value is 8 bits, no parity, 1 stop bit (8N1).  This command  allows
you to set the  number of bits to 7 or 8. The  parity to Odd, Even, Mark, Space
or None (only the first letter is used). and the number of stop bits to 1 or 2.

	POKE xxxx	=byte,[byte,byte,....,byte]

This command will allow the user to change bytes within the operating system.
Care must be  taken because with this command you can BOMB your system.  This
command works with  BANK 0 and NOT the TPA  (bank 1).  The address range that
can be changed in 1000 to FEFF, below 1000h is ROM.
POKE 4000=41 42 43 44 45	will write 41 to 4000 and 42 to 4001 etc.
POKE 4000=4142434445		will do the same as the above line

	PRT
	PRT1 or PRT2	= CBM, ASCII(secondary adr), MPS1000(in IBM mode)

This command allows you  to specify  whether true ASCII or PET ASCII will be
sent to a  printer on  the serial port.  The CBM parameter selects PET ASCII
with a secondary address of 7. (A secondary address of 7 selects upper/lower
case).  The  ASCII parameter selects true  ASCII and  defaults the secondary
address to 0.  If a number follows the command  it is used  as the secondary
address. The MPS1000 printer can be placed in true ASCII mode by placing DIP
switches 1 and 3 on and using the MPS1000 selection (same as =ASCII 128).

	REPEAT		=0,1,....

This command sets the rate at which keys will repeat. A parameter of 0 turns
off repeat; otherwise, the lower the number, the faster the repeat.

	VOL		=0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,...,15

This command  sets the volume of  the  keyclicks as specified by the associated
parameter. (0 turns the volume off; 15 sets the loudest keyclick; default is 6)
