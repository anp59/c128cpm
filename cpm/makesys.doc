     MAKESYS.DOC      08May87 CP/M 3.0 on the Commodore 128     28May87

     To generate a new  CPM+.SYS file used by CP/M on the Commodore 128
follow the procedure listed below.  You will need a 1581 disk drive for
this task.  Without a 1581,  you will have to make modifications to the
procedure to suit your system (refer to the MAKESYS instructions on the
5.25" diskette that accompanies the DRI manual offer).  If you're lucky
enough to possess a 1750 RAM expander,  you could use it  (drive M:) in
place of the 1581 work disk. This procedure requires a 400K work space.

1.   Create a 1581 work diskette, using the FORMAT  utility,  or  start
     with an empty RAMdisk (drive M:).

2.   Copy the following files to the work disk,  using the PIP utility:

     From USER 0:	(these are the utilities you will need)
                    RMAC.COM
                    MAC.COM
                    LINK.COM
                    GENCPM.COM
                    ADDBIOS.COM
                    SUBMIT.COM

     From USER 1:	(these are the data files)
                    CX80.ASM
                    CXDISK.ASM
                    CXEM.ASM
                    CXEXT.ASM
                    CXINTR.ASM
                    CXIO.ASM
                    CXKEY.ASM
                    CXKRNL.ASM
                    CXKYCODE.ASM
                    CXPRINTE.ASM
                    CXRAMDSK.ASM
                    CXSCB.ASM
                    CXVT.ASM
                    FAST8502.ASM

                    CPM3.LIB
                    CXEQU.LIB
                    MODEBAUD.LIB
                    X6502.LIB
                    Z80.LIB

                    BNKBDOS3.SPR
                    RESBDOS3.SPR

                    CZ.SUB
                    GENCPM.DAT

3.   Enter 'SUBMIT CZ' and the rest is almost automatic.  Just  answer
     'Y'  to  all  the  ERASE?  prompts.

4.   When the process is complete,  you will have a CPM+.SYS file that
     you can copy to any disk from which you want to be able to  boot.
     You also need to copy the  Console  Command  Processor  (CCP.COM)
     from USER 0 to the disk from which you want to boot.

5.   Details  regarding  System  Generation  can  be  found in the DRI
     System Guide. There are several differences to be noted, however,
     such as somewhat different module names and the implementation of
     system utilities such as COPYSYS and CPMLDR.
