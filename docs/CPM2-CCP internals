Internal CCP Commands
=====================

CP/M's resident command line interpreter, the CCP (Console Command
Processor) is  a special kind of transient program comprised of two
main parts: a program loader module and a resident command module. 
Both parts are contained in the file CCP.COM, which is
automatically loaded from the default drive (normally drive A:) by
CP/M during the cold boot-up process (i.e. initial start up of
CP/M).  System control is then passed to the CCP which initializes
a number of system parameters, copies itself to a buffer in bank 0,
then displays the familiar CP/M system prompt (A>) and awaits your
instructions.  (Note: There are numerous CCP replacement programs
available which add to or enhance the commands available in the
standard CCP.  These are not described in this book)

The program loader module of the CCP is used to read transient
utilities from disk into the Transient Program Area, or TPA, then
pass control to the transient program.  It moves itself into the
top of the TPA so that it can load the required file into the
beginning of the TPA without overwriting, and thus corrupting,
itself in the process.  Because some space is required at the top
of the TPA, the largest file which can be loaded by the CCP is 58
k bytes, on the AUG version of C-128 CP/M and 59 k on the DEC and
MAY versions.  Upon completion of the transient program, the CCP is
re-loaded from the buffer in bank 0 back into the TPA to await the
next instruction.

The command module of the CCP contains six fundamental commands as
outlined below.  Note that the resident version of these commands
is generally a 'plain vanilla' variety in that if you want to do
anything fancy like access password protected files or invoke
command options, you need to use an extended transient version of
the command.  The transient equivalents are stored as separate disk
files with the same name as the internal commands and a file type
of COM.  If you want to bypass the resident versions and access the
full transient versions directly, precede the command name with a
drive specifier.  For example:  DIR <return> will default to the
internal command DIR, while A:DIR <return> will access the
transient command DIR.COM on drive A:.  The transient versions of
each command are detailed in document "External Utilities".

Changing the Current Drive

The currently logged or default disk drive is the drive where CP/M
looks for files if no drive specifier is explicitly included in the
filespec.  The currently logged drive is displayed as part of the
system prompt in the form of:

            [user#][drive] >

such as 2A> to indicate that the system is currently logged onto
user area 2 on drive A:.

To change the current drive, type in the new drive letter followed
by a colon and a <return>.  For example:

      b: <return>
or    B: <return>

will change the currently logged drive to B:.  If you are already
logged onto drive B:, nothing will appear to happen.  However, if
you are logged onto another drive, the systems prompt will be
changed to reflect the new drive.  Changing the drive does not
change the user area.  For example, if you were logged on to USER
2  on drive A:, then switched to drive B:, you would be logged on
to USER 2 on drive B:.  See USER below to change the user area.

CP/M, in general, supports up to 16 logical drives, labelled A: to
P:.  The physical  nature of the logical drives is totally
transparent to CP/M commands and programs. These may be any
combination of floppy drives, hard drives, RAM disks and other
special devices.  In addition, more than one logical drive can be
mapped to a single physical drive.  On the standard C-128
implementation, only 5 or 6 logical drives are actually used. 
These are:

DRIVE             DEVICE

A:          serial port device 8, drive 0
B:          serial port device 9, drive 0
C:          serial port device 10, drive 0
D:          serial port device 11, drive 0
E:          serial port device 8, drive 0  
            (The virtual drive shares physical drive A:)
M:          17xx RAM expansion unit       (The RAM disk on CP/M versions
                                          dated 6 DEC 85 or later.)


The default device and drive numbers can be readily changed using
a program such as CONF.COM.

Soft Reset

If you type in a <control>-C (i.e. hold down the key marked
'CONTROL', while pressing the C key) at the system prompt, all
currently logged-in disk drives will become 'un-logged-in'.  This
has the effect of re-setting the disk system and cancelling all
previous disk error conditions.  This is also know as a 'warm boot'
or 'soft start'. 

If during the course of running an internal command or a transient
utility, the system aborts with an error message that starts of
similar to:

      BDOS Error on ... (etc) or

      BIOS Error on...(etc)


then it is a wise idea to reset the disk system with a <control>-C
before trying anything else.  Failing to do so, may just result in
the command being ignored and the error condition reported again.

<control>-C is also used by the resident commands, and many
transient commands as well, as a general "stop-what-you-are-doing-
and-return-to-system-level" command.  That is, it will terminate
directory displays, TYPE displays, etc.  It should be noted that
many transient programs will trap the <control>-C key press and use
the command for their own purposes, such as a custom exit routine.

NOTE:       <control>-C should be used with caution from within a
            transient program, especially if you do not know the
            command structure of the program.  It may terminate the
            program and leave you out in the cold with no practical
            way to recover any data that you may have previously
            entered but not saved.  For your own programs, you can
            disable <control>-C by using BDOS function 6Dh, described
            in the document "The CP/M BDOS".


DIR

The DIR command displays the names of files and, optionally the
characteristics associated with the files. It has three forms:

          DIR
          DIRSYS
          DIR (with Options)

DIR and DIRSYS are CCP resident commands.   DIR (with Options) is
a transient utility and must be loaded into memory from the disk. 
DIRSYS can be abbreviated to DIRS.  The general syntax for both DIR
and DIRS is:

                  DIR  {d:}
                  DIR  {ambiguous filespec}

                  DIRS {d:}
                  DIRS {ambiguous filespec}

The DIR and DIRS resident commands display the names of files
cataloged in the current user area of the directory of a disk.  DIR
lists the names of files in the current user number that have the
Directory (DIR) attribute set.  These would include most, if not
all, normal files on the disk.  (When a file is created, it is
normally given the directory attribute unless you specifically set
one of the other available attributes using the SET command or its
BDOS function call equivalent.)  DIRS lists all files on the disk
with the System (SYS) attribute set.  If system files are present
on a disk subjected to the DIR command, then the directory display
will also include the message:

      System file(s) exist.

Similarly, if files with the DIR attribute exist on a disk
subjected to the DIRS command, then the message:

      Non-System file(s) exist

will appear along with the directory listing.  If no files are in
the current user area on the disk, then the message 'No File' is
displayed.    DIR and DIRS will accept ambiguous filename
references (using the * and ? wildcards) in the file specification
for global pattern matching.   

For example:

Command                 What it does

DIR                     Displays all files in the current user area on
                        the current drive that  have the Directory
                        (DIR) attribute set.

DIR B:                  Displays all DIR files in the current user
                        area on drive B:.

DIR C:MYFILE.DAT        Displays the name MYFILE.DAT if the file is in
                        the current  user area on drive C:.

DIR *.BAS               Displays all DIR files with filetype BAS in
                        the current user area on the current drive.

DIR X*.C?D              Displays all DIR files in the current  user
                        area and drive whose filename begins with the
                        letter X, AND whose three character filetype
                        contains the first character C and last
                        character D.

DIRS                    Displays all files in the current user area
                        and drive that have the system (SYS) attribute
                        set. 

DIRS *.COM              Displays all SYS files with filetype COM in
                        the current user area and drive.  Note that a 
                        command (.COM)  file in user 0  with the
                        system attribute can be accessed from any user
                        number on that drive,  and from any drive in
                        the search chain (see SETDEF in "External
                        Utilities").



      
ERASE

The ERASE command removes one or more files from the directory of
a disk.  Ambiguous file references containing wildcard characters
('*' and '?') are acceptable in the filespec for deleting more than
one file which may match the specified pattern.  Directory and data
space on the disk are automatically reclaimed for later use by 
another  file.  ERASE can be abbreviated to ERA.  

Note:       the directory entry associated with the specified file(s)
            is not actually removed from the disk directory.  The
            first character of the directory field is changed to a
            hex E5 to indicate an unused entry which remains there
            until the space is reclaimed by creating a new file.  The
            old file can be recovered by special programming
            techniques until either its directory entry, or its
            allocated space has been re-used.

The syntax of the ERASE command is:

       ERASE {ambiguous filespec} 

For example:

Command                 What it does

ERASE TEST.BAS          Removes the file TEST.BAS from the current
                        user area in the current drive.

ERA *.PRN               All files with the filetype PRN are removed
                        from the current user area in the current 
                        drive.  Note that when a wild card is used in
                        the filespec, ERASE will prompt you to confirm
                        that you wish to perform the operation.

ERA C:*.*               All files in the current user area on drive C:
                        are removed from the disk.  As above, you will
                        be prompted to confirm your request.

ERA M?X.?M              All files which have a name that is 2 or 3
                        characters long that begins with M and ends in
                        X (such as MIX, MAX, MX) AND a file type of
                        one or two characters that ends with M (such
                        as M, AM, DM) will be erase from the current
                        user area in the current  drive.  


RENAME

RENAME lets you change the name of a file in the directory of a
disk.  The files are not physically moved or copied, only the name
in the directory is changed.  To change several filenames in one
command use the * or ?  wildcards in the file specifications. 
RENAME can be abbreviated to REN.  RENAME with no {filespec}
prompts you for input.  The syntax is:

       RENAME {new_filespec=old_filespec}



Some examples are:

Command                       What it does

REN FILE1.BAS=FILE2.BAS       The file FILE1.BAS changes to FILE2.BAS
                              on the current drive and user area.

RENAME                        The system prompts for the filespecs:

                                    Enter New Name:         X.PRN
                                    Enter Old Name:         Y.PRN
                                    Y      .PRN=X        .PRN
          
                              File X.PRN is then renamed to Y.PRN on
                              drive A:.

REN A:PRN.NEW=PRN.OLD         The file PRN.OLD on drive A: changes to
                              PRN.NEW.

RENAME X*.BAK=Z*.DOC          This command renames all the files
                              matching Z*.DOC to files with filenames
                              S*.BAK.

REN B:NEW=B:OLD               The file OLD changes to NEW on drive B:. 
                              Since the second drive specifier, B: is
                              implied by the first one, it is
                              unnecessary in this example.  The command
                              line above has the same effect as the
                              following:

                                    REN B:NEW=OLD
                                          or
                                    REN NEW=OLD

However, you cannot RENAME across drives.  Therefore:  

      REN A:FILE=B:FILE

is not legal.


TYPE

The TYPE command displays the contents of an ASCII character file
on your screen. (Strictly speaking, TYPE will display the contents
of any file, but only ones with ASCII text, or WordStar style text,
will make any sense when viewed.)  TYPE will NOT accept wildcards
in the filename.  The general syntax is:

          TYPE {unambiguous filespec}


      For example,

Command                 What it does

TYPE LETTER.DOC         Displays the contents of the file LETTER.DOC
                        from the current drive on your screen.

TYPE B:LETTER.DOC       Displays the contents of the file LETTER.DOC
                        from drive B: on your screen. 



You can also get a printed copy of the file by pressing <control>-P
using TYPE to toggle the printer echo on.  Everything that is
displayed on the screen will then be echoed to the printer.  To
start printing in the middle of a display, press <control>-S to
stop the display, then <control>-P to activate the printer and
<control>-Q to resume the display.  Only text which is displayed
after the <control>-P will be echoed to the printer.

TYPE will normall display 23 lines, then prompt to press a key for
the next page.  This feature can be de-activated using the [NO
PAGE] option of the TYPE.COM transient utility.  

You can press <control>-C to abort the display at any time.


USER

The USER command sets the current user number.    The disk
directory can be sub-divided into distinct areas, generally called
a 'user area' according to a "User Number."  User numbers range
from 0 through 15.  These can be considered to be a form of a
subdirectory, although the directory entries for all user areas
occupy part of the same physical directory area on the disk.  The
default user area is 0.

Files located in one user area are not generally accessible from
other user areas without special programming techniques.  The
general exception to this rule is files in user 0 which have the
system attribute set.  These files are available in all user areas. 
File copying programs such as PIP can copy from any user area to
any other one, provided that PIP is accessible in the currently
selected user area.  

Note that the currently selected user number is the same for all
drives.   That is, if you are on drive A: in user area 4, changing
to drive B: will automatically put you into user area 4 on drive
B:.  The current user area is displayed as part of the system
prompt in the form of:

            [user#][drive] >

such as 2A> to indicate that the system is currently logged onto
user area 2 on drive A:.

The syntax for the USER command is:

                  USER {number}

where {number} is the desired user area, expressed as a decimal
number from 0 to 15.  For example,


Command                 What it does

USER                    The CCP prompts you to enter the desired user
                        number:

                              Enter User#:
 
                        To which you can respond:           5

                        and the current user number will be set at 5. 
                        This is indicated by the system prompt which
                        will read 5A> (if drive A: is currently
                        selected as the default drive).

USER 3                  This command changes the current user number
                        to 3.


Note:       The USER command does not reserve certain segments of the
            disk for a given area, nor does it create special
            additional directory areas or sub-directories.  The files
            for all 'user areas' are physically mixed on the disk. 
            Files for each area are identified in the directory by a
            control byte in the directory entry.  (See "The Disk
            System" for additional information.)
