                               The Console
                               ===========
                                    

The Command Line
             
Keys For Processing CP/M Command Line

The key labelled CRSR with up and down arrows (bottom right on
keyboard) generates the value 17 (same as '<CONTROL>-w') and
causes the latest CP/M command line to be displayed on the
screen.  The key next to this (CRSR with right and left arrows)
allows you to move right and left (unshifted and shifted,
respectively) through this command string to edit.  This is
useful for correcting typing mistakes in lengthy command
sequences.


Selectively Displayed Disk Status Line

There is an optional disk status displayed at the bottom right
corner of the screen. The format of this status line is as
follows:

               O Dtt ss
where: O  =Operation, either R or W indicating a Read or Write 
       D  =the logical drive (A,B,C,D, etc)
      tt  =the track number currently being read or written
      ss  =the sector number currently being read or written

Normally, the track and sector number are separated by a space. 
If the disk is formatted MFM, and the track and sector are
separated by a '-', the second side of the disk is currently
being accessed.

You can toggle this status to be displayed or not by typing the
RUN/STOP key and the control key simultaneously.


Keyboard Definitions

The Commodore 128 Keyboard is defined for CP/M as follows:

Each key has 4 values associated with it. These are defined as
the unshifted, value, the shifted value, the control value and
the CAPS LOCK value.  The UNSHIFTED value is basically the key as
labelled, and is produced by typing the key; the SHIFTED value
represents the key, as labelled, when typed with one of the SHIFT
keys on either side of the space bar; the CONTROL value is the
value produced by typing the key and the CONTROL key
simultaneously; the CAPS LOCK value is the value produced when in
CAPS LOCK mode. (CAPS LOCK mode is entered by typing the
COMMODORE key and remains in effect until this key is typed
again.  This value is therefore typically documented as the CAPS
LOCK value.) 


SPECIAL KEYS

Numeric Keys

The alpha keys generate the standard lower case, upper case and
control values. The CAPS LOCK value is merely the upper case
value. The numeric keys (the row of keys above the alpha keys)
produce the appropriate number as the unshifted value and the
CAPS LOCK value, the symbol above the number on the key as the
shifted value and the color on the side of the key (the top one
of the two colors shown) as the control value.  These colors are
defined as 80 column foreground colors.  The control value
produced by the numbers on the numeric keypad are defined the
same as those on the numeric keys, except that they generate 80
column background colors.

 
Arrow Keys

The up arrow key generates the value 05 (same as 'CONTROLe') as
the unshifted, shifted and CAPS LOCK values;  it generates the
hexadecimal 12 (same as 'CONTROLr') as the control value.

The down arrow key generates the hexadecimal value 18 (same as
'CONTROLx') as the unshifted, shifted and CAPS LOCK values; it
generates the value 03 (same as 'CONTROLc') as the control value.

The left arrow key generates the hexadecimal value 14 (same as
'CONTROLs') as the unshifted, shifted and CAPS LOCK values; it
executes the 40 column screen left function as the control value.

The right arrow key generates the value 04 (same as 'CONTROLd')
as the unshifted, shifted and CAPS LOCK values; it executes the
40 column screen right functions as the control value.


Additional Key Characters

The key labelled as a British pound sign generates the character
'#' as the unshifted, shifted and CAPS LOCK values; the character
'`' is generated as the control value.
 
The up arrow key next to the RESTORE key generates the character
'^' as the shifted and control values; the pipe character '|' is
generated as the unshifted and CAPS LOCK values. 

The '=' key generates the character '=' as the unshifted, shifted
and CAPS LOCK values; the character '~' is generated as the
control value.

The '/' key generates the character '/' as the unshifted, shifted
and CAPS LOCK values; the character '\' is generated as the
control value.

The key labelled 'INST DEL' generates the hexadecimal value 7f
(ASCII rubout) as the unshifted, shifted and CAPS LOCK values;
the hexadecimal value 16 (same as 'CONTROL v' is generated as the
control value.


DEFAULT KEYBOARD VALUES

The default keyboard definition values are as follows (values in
hex, sorted by 'Unshifted' value):

Control/Right SHIFT Functions

There are 3 functions which are selected by typing the CONTROL
key, the RIGHT SHIFT key (the SHIFT key to the right of the space
bar) and the appropriate key for the desired function
simultaneously. The 3 keys to enable the desired functions are:
the key labelled ALT, which is used to select between remote and
local handling of certain key values, the right arrow key which
is used to initiate editing function keys, and the left arrow
key, which is used to initiate replacement of key values with a
hexadecimal value. The last 2 functions allow you to edit key
definitions directly, without using the KEYFIG program.  


 <Control Rt SHFT ALT> Mode Toggle

The key labelled ALT is used to toggle between handling certain
functions at the keyboard level or passing the appropriate key
code to a remote application for processing.  These functions
include all hexadecimal key values between 80 and ff. These are
defined as follows:

80-9f     identify function strings
a0-af     identify 80 column foreground colors
b0-bf     identify 80 column background colors
c0-cf     identify 40 column foreground colors
d0-df     identify 40 column background colors
e0-ef     identify 40 column border colors
f0-ff     identify special functions

The default mode is that these keycodes are handled locally.  In
this mode, the functions as defined above are executed.  If
remote handling of these codes is selected, the appropriate
keycode (80-ff) is passed along to a remote application which
processes it however it wishes.

 
String Edit <CTL RTSHFT Right Arrow>       

To edit a string type the CONTROL KEY,  the RIGHT SHIFT key and
the RIGHT ARROW key simultaneously,  then type the key to which
you want to assign the string. Note that the key you pick must
already have a string value (80-9F) assigned to it.

A window will pop up at the bottom of the screen, in which you
will edit. Type the string and type CONTROL, RIGHT SHIFT, RETURN
to exit. For editing, you can use CONTROL, RIGHT SHIFT, RIGHT
ARROW or LEFT ARROW to move right or left through the string and
CONTROL RIGHT SHIFT + or - to insert or delete a character
respectively.


Editing the Hexadecimal Value of a Key   

To assign a single hex value, type CONTROL,RIGHT SHIFT and LEFT
ARROW key simultaneously.  Type the key you want to modify. A
window will pop up at the bottom of the screen showing the
current hex value, per the current mode (unshifted, shifted, CAPS
LOCK or control). Enter the new hex value. NOTE that any illegal
key will abort the edit without modifying the key.


Keys Initiating Special Functions

The key labelled NO SCROLL executes a PAUSE function. To resume
execution, press NO SCROLL again (for AUG or DEC version only) or
RETURN (for MAY version only).  This has the same effect as
typing control-s for pausing to read screen dumps. The control
value of the NO SCROLL key toggles between two modes (on/off) of
automatically tracking the CP/M screen on a 40 column monitor.

The right and left arrows at the top of the keyboard initiate the
special functions screen right and screen left respectively (40
column screen tracking) as their unshifted, shifted and CAPS LOCK
values.

The key labelled ENTER generates a Carriage Return as the
unshifted, shifted and CAPS LOCK values.  The control value
initiates the special function boot, which reboots the system.

The key labelled RUN STOP is undefined as its unshifted, shifted
and CAPS LOCK values, and toggles the display/nondisplay of the
disk status line as its control value.


CP/M 3 Command Format:

     A>COMMAND {command tail} <cr>

A CP/M 3 command line is composed of a command, an optional
command tail, and a carriage return. The command is the name or
filename of a program to be executed. The optional command tail
can consist of a drive specification, one or more file
specifications, and some options or parameters.

          filetype.
     ?         wildcard: replaces any single character in the
               same position of a filename and/or filetype.



 Control Character       Function

 CTRL-A             moves cursor one character to the left. 

 CTRL-B             moves cursor from beginning to end of command
                    line and back without affecting command.
 
 CTRL-C             stops executing program when entered at the
                    system prompt or after CTRL-S.

 CTRL-E             forces a physical carriage return without
                    sending command. 

 CTRL-F             moves cursor one character to the right. 

 CTRL-G             deletes character at current cursor position
                    if in the middle of a line. 

 CTRL-H             delete character to the left of cursor.

 CTRL-I             same as the TAB key.

 CTRL-J             moves cursor to the left of the command line
                    and sends command to CP/M. Line feed, has
                    same effect as carriage return.

 CTRL-K             deletes character at cursor and all
                    characters to the right.

 CTRL-M             same as carriage return.

 CTRL-P             echoes console output to the list device.

 CTRL-Q             restarts screen scrolling after a CTRL-S.

 CTRL-R             retypes the characters to the left of the
                    cursor on a new line; updates the command
                    line buffer.

 CTRL-S             stops screen scrolling.

 CTRL-U             updates the command line buffer to contain
                    the characters to the left of the cursor;
                    deletes current line.

 CTRL-W             recalls previous command line if current line
                    is empty; otherwise moves cursor to end of
                    line. CTRL-J,-M,-R,-U and RETURN update the
                    command line buffer for recall with CTRL-W. 

 CTRL-X             deletes all characters to the left of the
                    cursor.


Console Utilities:

Redirection using GET

 Syntax:

GET {CONSOLE INPUT FROM} FILE filespec{[{ECHO|NO ECHO} | SYSTEM]}
GET {CONSOLE INPUT FROM} CONSOLE

GET directs the system to take console input from a file for the
next system command or user program entered at the console.
Console input is taken from a file until the program terminates.
If the file is exhausted before program input is terminated, the
program looks for subsequent input from the console. If the
program terminates before exhausting all its input, the system
reverts back to the console for console input.

With the SYSTEM option, the system immediately goes to the
specified file for console input. The system reverts to the
console for input when it reaches the end of file. Re-direct the
system to the console for console input with the:

 GET CONSOLE INPUT FROM CONSOLE 

command as a command line in the input file.

Options

 ECHO                 specifies that input is echoed to the
                      console.  This is the default option.

 NO ECHO         specifies that file input is not echoed to
                 the console. The program output and the
                 system prompts are not affected by this
                 option and are still echoed to the console.

 SYSTEM          specifies that all system input is
                 immediately taken from the disk file
                 specified in the command line. GET takes
                 system and program input from the file until
                 the file is exhausted or until GET reads a
                 GET console command from the file.

Examples

 A>GET FILE XINPUT
 A>MYPROG

Tells the system to activate the GET utility. Since SYSTEM is not
specified, the system reads the next input line from the console
and  executes MYPROG.   If MYPROG program requires console input,
it is taken from the file XINPUT. When MYPROG terminates, the
system reverts back to the console for console input.

 A>GET FILE XIN2 [SYSTEM]

Immediately directs the system to get subsequent console input
from file XIN2 because it includes the SYSTEM option. The system
reverts back to the console for console input when it reaches the
end of file in XIN2. Or XIN2 may redirect the system back to the
console if it contains a GET CONSOLE command.

 A>GET CONSOLE

Tells the system to get console input from the console. This
command may be used in a file (previously specified in a GET FILE
command), which is already being read by the system for console
input. It is used to re-direct the console input back to the
console before the end-of-file is reached.


Keyboard Redefinition with KEYFIG

The purpose of the KEYFIG program is to allow you to alter the
definition of almost ANY key on the keyboard. The only keys that
you CANNOT modify are: the SHIFT keys, the SHIFT LOCK key, the
CONTROL key, the 40/80 DISPLAY key and the COMMODORE key. At each
step, options are presented in menu form. You can scroll through
the options in the menus by using the up and down arrow keys at
the top of the keyboard; pressing the return key selects the
choice that is highlighted. 

At almost any point, you can exit the program by typing 'CTRL c'
(the CONTROL key and C simultaneously.)
                   
Selecting a Key to Edit

To select a key for editing,  you must actually select the
specific (1 of 4) value of the key that you want to modify. To do
this, type the key so that the four values associated with it are
displayed.  Use the up and down arrow keys to scroll through the
four values; type the return key to select the value that is
highlighted.  This is the specific key value that will be
modified.  The next time you view this key the new value you
assigned will be displayed. You can modify as many keys as you
want. When you are done, select the fifth choice - "exit and save
work file".  (NOTE: To view the up arrow, down arrow or return
key, type the desired key and the control key simultaneously). 
                 

Setting Up Your Work File

The first thing you will be asked to do is set up your work file.
You will be given a choice of 3 sources from which you can do
this:

DEFAULT DEFINITIONS   which basically represent a standard set
                      of key definitions.
CURRENT DEFINITIONS   which represent the most recently loaded
                      set of definitions. 
DEFINITIONS ON BOOT DISK   which represent the set of definitions
                           stored on your boot disk, normally
                           default definitons, unless you replace
                           them via this program.
                

What To Do With Your Work File 

Once your work file is set up, you will be given a choice of 3
things to do: 

EDIT KEYS        which allows you to modify key definitions. 

ASSIGN COLORS         which allows you to redefine the meaning
                      associated with a particular color. 

EXIT AND SAVE         This is provided here as a quick means of
                      copying one set of definitions to another. 
                      For example, loading the default definitions
                      into your work file and saving them as the
                      current definitions, provides a means of
                      restoring your current definitions after
                      running an application which may have used a
                      now undesired set of key definitions.   
Editing Keys

Once you have selected a specific key value to edit, you will be
given a choice of 5 ways of modifying the key:

ASSIGN a new character     which allows you to do a 'one-for-one'
                           replacement of the key.
ASSIGN a STRING            which allows you to assign/edit a string
                           (more than 1 character) to the key
ASSIGN a COLOR             which allows you to assign an 80 or a 40
                           column color
ASSIGN special function    which allows you to assign a function
                           from a list of currently available
                           special functions.
ASSIGN a HEX value         which allows you to replace the key
                           value with a single hex value.

                
Assigning/Editing Color Values

Once you have chosen to assign a color, you will be given a
choice of 5 color types to assign: an 80 column foreground color,
an 80 column background color, a 40 column foreground color, a 40
column background color or a 40 column border color.  Scroll
through and select the one you want to assign. At this point, a
color map consisting of 16 boxes labelled 'a' through 'p' will be
displayed.  Type the letter from the box representing the color
that you want to assign.  (NOTE that one letter (usually 'a')
will appear to be missing, because it blends with the background
color - assume ALL boxes are lettered sequentially!)
              

Assigning/Editing Hexadecimal Values            

Once you have chosen to assign a hex value to a key, you will be
prompted for the value to assign.  Only charactersfrom 0-9 and a-
f (upper or lower case) will be accepted.  As you type
characters, the current value is shifted left one nibble and the
new value is ORed into the lst nibble.  You can type as many
characters as you want, but the last 2 you type will be the value
assigned to the key.  Type return when you are finished. Note:
The value you type when the four key values are displayed will
not be displayed as hex, but as what the hex value represents.

WARNING:    This mode should only be used by those familiar with
            hexadecimal data.
              

Assigning/Editing Special Functions

Once you have chosen to assign a special function you will be
given a list of 16 currently available special functions. Scroll
through the list and assign the function that you want this key
to perform.
            

Assigning/Editing Strings

Once you have chosen to assign a string, you will be given a list
of 32 available strings (some of which may already be defined.)
Scroll through and select the one you want to assign to this key. 
At this point, the one you choose will be displayed near the top
of the screen for editing. You can edit by typing keys and/or by
choosing one of the menu options presented - insert a color,
insert a hex value, insert a special function or a second string
(warning - the remainder of the string will be deleted if you
insert a second string.) You can also use the left and right
arrow keys and the insert and delete keys.   When you are done,
select the menu choice "exit string edit and save assigned
string".
               

Finishing Up-Saving Your Work File

Once you have loaded your workfile and completed any editing you
wanted to do, you will be given three choices as to what to do
with your work file:
 
SAVE AS CURRENT       which makes the definitions in your work file
                      effective immediately upon exiting this
                      program
SAVE ON CP/M DISK     which will cause the definitions in your
                      work file to be loaded the next time you
                      boot from the disk to which it was saved
DON'T SAVE       a means of exiting if you made a mistake
                 or changed your mind. 
                     




Redirect Console Output with PUT

 Syntax:

    PUT CONSOLE {OUTPUT TO} FILE filespec {option} | CONSOLE
    PUT PRINTER {OUTPUT TO} FILE filespec {option} | PRINTER
    PUT CONSOLE {OUTPUT TO} CONSOLE
    PUT PRINTER {OUTPUT TO} PRINTER


PUT puts console or printer output to a file for the next command
entered at the console, until the program terminates. Then
console output reverts to the console. Printer output is directed 
to a file until the program terminates. Then printer output is
put back to the printer.

PUT with the SYSTEM option directs all subsequent console/printer
output to the specified file. This option terminates when you
enter the PUT CONSOLE or  PUT PRINTER command.

 Options

         [ {ECHO | NO ECHO} {FILTER | NO FILTER} | {SYSTEM} ]

 ECHO            specifies that output is echoed to the
                 console. This is the default option when you
                 direct console output to a file.

 NO ECHO         specifies that file output is not echoed to
                 the console. NO ECHO is the default for the
                 PUT PRINTER command.

 FILTER          specifies filtering of control characters,
                 which means that control characters are
                 translated to printable characters.  For
                 example, an  ESCape character is translated
                 to ^[.

 NO FILTER            means  that  PUT does not translate control
                      characters. This is the default option.

 SYSTEM          specifies that system output as well as
                 program output is written to  the  file
                 specified by filespec. Output is written to
                 the file until a subsequent  PUT CONSOLE
                 command redirects console output back to the
                 console.

 Examples

 A>PUT CONSOLE OUTPUT TO FILE XOUT [ECHO]

Directs console output to file XOUT with the output echoed to the
console.

 A>PUT PRINTER OUTPUT TO FILE XOUT
 A>MYPROG

Directs the printer output of program MYPROG to file XOUT. The
output is not echoed to the printer.

 A>PUT PRINTER OUTPUT TO FILE XOUT2 [ECHO,SYSTEM]

Directs all printer output to file XOUT2 as well as to the
printer (with ECHO option), and the PUT is in effect until you
enter a PUT PRINTER OUTPUT TO PRINTER command.

 A>PUT CONSOLE OUTPUT TO CONSOLE

Directs console output back to the console.

 A>PUT PRINTER OUTPUT TO PRINTER

Directs printer output back to the printer.



Displaying a File with TYPE

 Syntax:

       TYPE {filespec {[ PAGE | NOPAGE ]}}


The TYPE command  displays  the  contents  of  an   ASCII
character file on your screen.

 [PAGE]          Causes the console listing to be displayed in
                 paged mode;  i.e., stop automatically after
                 listing n lines of text, where n normally
                 defaults to 24 lines per page.

 [NOPAGE]        Turns off Console Page Mode and continuously
                 displays a typed file on the screen.



TERMINAL EMULATION PROTOCOLS

ADM31 Mode

ADM31 mode is the default terminal mode for all versions of C-128
CP/M. In fact, it is the only mode available for the AUG and DEC
versions. (The MAY version also supports VT-100, if you re-
assemble the system files from scratch with the VT-100 option
enabled). The control codes for ADM31 mode and its various sub
modes are outlined below. The ^ means hold down <control> key.
Escape (ESC) sequences are activated by printing the character
sequence to the console.
